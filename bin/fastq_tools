Usage: fastq_tools [options] -i <FASTQ>
Required:	
    -i STR  input FASTQ(.gz) file of shuffled reads
    -t STR  task to be run (kmer/coverage/split/histogram)
Options:
    -g INT  genome size of the coverage task []
    -h      print this message and exit
        
'kmer': Calculate 66% and 90% of median read length as minimum and maximum kmer sizes. Uses for running VelvetOptimiser
'coverage': Given a genome size, calculates the coverage
'split': Takes a shuffled fastq file and splits into forward and reverse based on /1 or /2 in the ID
'histogram': Produces a file called histogram.png in current directory with a histogram of the read lengths

USAGE

if(($task eq 'coverage') and (not defined($genome_size))){

	die "To calculate coverage, please provide the genome size. Use -h to see options. \n";
}

	case "histogram"    { $fastq_processor->draw_histogram_of_read_lengths(); }

						}
	case "coverage"		{
						my $coverage = $fastq_processor->calculate_coverage($genome_size);
						print "Coverage is $coverage x \n"; 
						}
	case "split"		{
						$fastq_processor->split_fastq();
						print "File split into forward.fastq and reverse.fastq \n";
						}
